# Setting Up TFT library

These files are to be added to your TFT_eSPI library. The images below show the location of this library folder. Grab the zip file here and unzip to your desktop or area of your choice. Inside the zip is 6 files that you will need to move into the tft_espi library main folder. After moving these files locate and open the User_Setup_Select.h file.

Inside this file locate the display you are using. (Use pic for ref)
To use the display/device of your choice remove the // infront of the entry. Make sure only one display is uncommented at a time and also pay attention to the name to minimize error.
